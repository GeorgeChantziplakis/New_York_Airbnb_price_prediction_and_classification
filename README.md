# New_York_Airbnb_price_prediction_and_classification
Academic Project

One of my first university courseworks. The task was to apply Machine Learning techniques for a real life problem. The dataset was selected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data).

Four different models for predicting the price of an Airbnb apartment based on features like neighborhood, availability, seasonality, etc were created. The regression models used were Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression. Also, I wanted to gain some more info and made some classification models. Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification, and KNN were implemented for predicting whether an apartment will be classified as Low or High price. The project has been done in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.8 with the aim of Sci-Kit learn, NumPy and Pandas libraries.
